                    <h3>Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Conducted a comprehensive forensic investigation of the "Catbomber" malware incident using Wireshark to analyze network traffic and identify compromised systems. This project demonstrated real-world Network Security Monitoring (NSM) techniques used in enterprise environments.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
                    <p>• Identified two infected clients (10.5.28.229 and 10.5.28.8) by filtering HTTP traffic and examining TLS handshakes to trace malware communication patterns</p>
                    <p>• Extracted critical exfiltrated data including usernames, hostnames, email credentials, and passwords from captured network packets</p>
                    <p>• Discovered and verified malicious files (imgpaper and cursor) as Indicators of Compromise by extracting file hashes and validating them through VirusTotal</p>
                    <p>• Analyzed fake SSL certificates used in post-infection traffic over TCP ports 443, 447, and 449 to identify command-and-control communications</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project taught me how to perform packet-level forensic analysis to reconstruct attack timelines and identify breach impacts. I gained hands-on experience with PCAP file analysis, understanding how to trace malware propagation between network clients, and how attackers exfiltrate sensitive data. The exercise reinforced the critical importance of Network Security Monitoring for discovering, investigating, and reporting cybersecurity incidents in real-time.</p>

                    <h3>Intrusion Detection & Prevention System Implementation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Deployed and configured Snort IDS/IPS on a pfSense firewall to create a multi-layered defense-in-depth security architecture. This project simulated real-world network attacks and demonstrated how intrusion detection systems protect enterprise networks from both external and internal threats.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
                    <p>• Successfully installed Snort with GPLv2 Community Rules and configured automatic daily rule updates to maintain current threat detection signatures</p>
                    <p>• Created both WAN and LAN interface monitoring to detect external attacks and internal threats including malware downloads, lateral movement, and policy violations</p>
                    <p>• Developed custom Snort rules for content-based detection and IP-specific monitoring, validating that custom signatures load and execute correctly</p>
                    <p>• Simulated an internal threat by hosting malware (cursor.png containing a hidden Windows executable) on a Kali Linux Apache server, which Snort successfully detected as a "Network Trojan" despite the disguised file extension</p>
                    <p>• Captured and analyzed traffic using pfSense packet capture tools and Wireshark to verify that Snort alerts aligned with actual malicious payloads in network traffic</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project gave me deep insight into defense-in-depth strategies and how multiple independent security controls work together to prevent single points of failure. I learned the critical difference between IDS (detection and alerts) and IPS (detection plus active blocking), and how Snort can function as both. The hands-on experience with creating custom detection rules taught me how to tune security systems for specific threats and IOC-based detections. Most importantly, I understood the limitations of IDS/IPS with encrypted HTTPS traffic, highlighting critical blind spots in network security.</p>

                    <h3>Windows Password Authentication & Hash Cracking Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Analyzed Windows authentication protocols and demonstrated password vulnerability through network traffic interception and hash cracking techniques. This project simulated how attackers capture and crack password hashes, providing crucial insights into password security best practices.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
                    <p>• Captured Windows NTLMv2 authentication traffic using Wireshark, demonstrating how eavesdroppers can intercept challenge-response protocols even when passwords aren't transmitted in plaintext</p>
                    <p>• Extracted complete password hashes from network packets including username, domain name, server challenge, NTProofStr, and NTLMv2 response with precise syntax formatting</p>
                    <p>• Performed offline password cracking attacks using Hashcat on Kali Linux with both dictionary attacks (rockyou.txt wordlist) and brute-force methods to crack captured hashes</p>
                    <p>• Analyzed cracking time scaling from seconds for common passwords to virtually impossible for 16+ character complex passwords, demonstrating the exponential protection that password length provides</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project revealed the vulnerabilities in Windows authentication and why password complexity requirements exist. I learned that password length is even more critical than character substitutions when defending against brute-force attacks due to exponential time scaling. The exercise demonstrated why attackers prefer wordlist attacks (relying on users choosing common passwords) over computationally expensive brute-force methods. Most importantly, I gained practical understanding of why unique passwords, password managers, and multi-factor authentication are essential security practices, as they defend against both hash capture and credential stuffing attacks.</p>

            <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
            <p>My short-term goal is to establish myself as a skilled cybersecurity professional, gaining real-world experience in threat detection and incident response. Long-term, I aim to advance into specialized roles such as Security Architect or Penetration Testing Lead, where I can design comprehensive security solutions and mentor others in the field. I'm committed to continuous learning through certifications like Security+, CEH, and eventually CISSP to stay current with industry standards and emerging threats.</p>

            <h3>What I Bring</h3>
            <p>I offer a unique combination of technical expertise and practical experience gained through academic projects, competitive cybersecurity challenges with the National Cyber League, and hands-on work as a Network Technician Assistant. My projects demonstrate proficiency in network traffic analysis, intrusion detection systems, and password security assessment. I'm a strong communicator who can translate complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders, and I approach every challenge with accountability and attention to detail—skills refined through both my cybersecurity coursework and professional experience.</p>
