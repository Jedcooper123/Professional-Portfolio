                <p>
                    As a recent CIS graduate with a Cybersecurity concentration from ASU, I thrive in a hands-on environment. 
                    Most of my work has been around networks, passwords and small business technology. I’ve completed a 
                    rewarding internship which provided comprehensive experience in many areas of information technology. 
                    In addition to the internship, I’m proud of my track record of working throughout my college career.

                October 2024 – July 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Helped customers with broken or slow PCs, data transfers, and general “my computer is acting weird” issues.
                    On the networking side, I assisted with installs and troubleshooting for security cameras, PCs,
                    Starlink setups, and small office networks. It gave me a good feel for how messy real environments can be
                    and how important clear documentation is.

                Geeks at Work is a small IT shop in Boone that supports a mix of homes and local businesses.
                I split my time between in-store repair work and field installs – everything from cameras and Wi-Fi
                to Starlink and network racks. This section walks through some of the installs and hands-on work
                I did while I was there.

                        and switches were wired in a way that’s easy to maintain later.

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this lab I worked through the “Catbomber” scenario, which simulates a malware infection
                        inside a company network. I used Wireshark and a PCAP file to figure out which machines
                        were infected, what data was stolen, and which files were actually malicious.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I Approached It</h3>
                    <p>
                        • Started by opening the PCAP and looking at high-level HTTP and TLS traffic.<br>
                        • Followed specific TCP streams to see what data was being sent out from clients.<br>
                        • Used IP configuration data in the packets to tie activity back to hostnames and users.<br>
                        • Exported suspicious files from the capture, hashed them, and checked them on VirusTotal.<br>
                        • Looked at post-infection TLS traffic and certificates to spot command-and-control behavior.
                    </p>

                        By walking through the PCAP step by step, I was able to identify two infected hosts, see exactly
                        what data left the network, and confirm which files were malware. This is the kind of workflow
                        you’d use in a real incident: use traffic to rebuild what happened instead of guessing.

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        This lab focuses on Snort running on a pfSense firewall. I set up custom and pre-built rules,
                        watched alerts fire in real time, and then used packet captures and Wireshark to prove what
                        the alerts were actually seeing on the wire.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I Approached It</h3>
                    <p>
                        • Enabled Snort on the LAN interface of pfSense with a <em>custom.rules</em> file for testing.<br>
                        • Wrote a simple rule that alerts any time traffic includes my name “Jed” going to or from
                          the Windows server, just to prove rules are working.<br>
                        • Hosted a suspicious PNG file on a Kali Apache server and had the Windows client download it.<br>
                        • Captured traffic on pfSense, pulled it into Wireshark, and used an Emerging Threats rule set
                          to detect the PNG that secretly contains an EXE.<br>
                        • Verified inside Wireshark that the “image” payload actually starts with an <code>MZ</code>
                          executable header.
                    </p>

                        warning, but the real value comes from validating those alerts with packet captures and
                        understanding the story behind each event.

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project looks at how Windows NTLMv2 logins travel over the network and what happens if an
                        attacker captures those logins. I used Wireshark to grab NTLMv2 authentication traffic, built a
                        hash file in the format Hashcat expects, and then tried cracking it with a common password list.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I Approached It</h3>
                    <p>
                        • Captured NTLMv2 authentication traffic on the network using Wireshark filters.<br>
                        • Pulled out the server challenge and NTLMv2 response fields from the packets.<br>
                        • Built a <code>hashes.txt</code> file in the <code>user::domain:challenge:response</code> format that
                          Hashcat needs.<br>
                        • Moved the hash file over to Kali Linux and ran Hashcat (mode 5600) with the
                          <code>rockyou.txt</code> wordlist.<br>
                        • Reviewed the results to see whether any of the users were using weak, crackable passwords.
                    </p>

                                Filtering on <code>ntlmssp</code> in Wireshark highlights the NTLMv2 authentication packet.
                                From here I copy the NTLM response fields that will later be fed into Hashcat.

                                The server challenge packet provides the 8-byte random value that, combined with the user’s
                                password and other fields, forms the NTLMv2 hash. Attackers need both pieces: the challenge
                                and the response.

                                <code>user::domain:challenge:response</code> format and save it as <code>hashes.txt</code>.
                                This is exactly what Hashcat expects when cracking NTLMv2 hashes.

                                From this point on, all cracking happens offline so there are no account lockouts or logs
                                on the domain controller.

                                Looking back at the NTLM details in Wireshark, I can match each hash to a real domain
                                user and workstation. That’s important for reporting and for recommending which accounts
                                need password resets.

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>
                        NTLMv2 hashes are not plain-text passwords, but once they’re captured, they can still be attacked
                        offline. Long, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication make this kind of attack much
                        harder, which is why those controls matter even on internal networks.

                <p>
                    I'm looking for a security-focused role where I can stay hands-on: SOC work, network security,
                    or a hybrid IT/cyber role for a smaller team. I like digging into logs and traffic, tracking down
                    weird behavior, and helping people understand what actually happened.

                <p>
                    Short term, I want to be a part of something where I can keep learning every day and get more real incident experience.
                    I'm working toward certifications like Security+ and I want to keep building home labs and projects that
                    line up with what I’ll see on the job.

                <p>
                    Long term, I'd like to grow into a role where I’m helping design the overall security picture for a company
                    or leading a team. I like the mix of technical work, big-picture thinking, and explaining risk to people
                    who don’t live in security all day.

                <h3>What I Bring</h3>
                <p>
                    I bring a mix of lab work, real customer-facing experience, and a genuine interest in how systems fail.
                    I’m comfortable getting into packet captures, tuning rules, and troubleshooting weird network behavior,
                    but I’m also used to talking to non-technical users who just want things to work. I document what I do
                    and try to leave things cleaner than I found them.
